# ts-express
Minimal TypeScript express setup

You need nodemon installed to run this example. If you don't like nodemon, please update package.json.

```
npm i -g nodemon
```

## Get started

First use `npm install` to install all dependencies. There are some very basic integration tests that can be executed using 
`npm test`. To run the application use `npm start`
